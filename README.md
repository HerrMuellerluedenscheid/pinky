Pinky
-----

Pinky is a simple deep learning toolbox for earthquake localization and detection, for an example study have a look at our application of a [CNN with 3 convolutional layers to a West Bohemia earthquake swarm](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220180320).

To get started, have a look at our small synthetic example generator in the 'example' subdirectory.



Prereqs
-------

 - [pyrocko](https://pyrocko.org/)
 - [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - scikit-optimize (optional for hyperparameter optimization)

You can use pip to install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that this will install tensorflow without GPU support. Checkout the [tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) to install with GPU support


Invocation
----------

You need to provide pinky with a configuration file.

    pinky --config <config_filename>


Check data
----------

A good starting point to see if data is properly loaded an preprocessed is to
have look at a couple of examples.

    pinky --config <config_filename> --show-data 9

This will generate a figure with 9 panels show the first 9 preprocessed data labels and
features from your dataset.


Training
--------

To start training:

    pinky --config <config_filename> --train

You can dump your examples to TFRecordDatasets to accelerate io operations:

    pinky --config <config_filename> --write <new_config_filename>

and use the newly created config file to run `--train`

Invoke pinky with `--debug` to enable keep track of weight matrices in
[tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard).
